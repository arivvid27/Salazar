The event handlers provided seem to only clear the input fields on the first click, which is a usability feature and not directly related to XSS. The absence of URL parameters also reduces the attack surface for reflected XSS. However, a complete analysis requires inspecting the server-side code and how the input from the three fields is handled."

However, the absence of identified JavaScript sinks, DOM XSS patterns, and URL parameters significantly reduces the likelihood of successful exploitation. The event handlers observed are simple and do not appear to directly interact with user input in a way that would enable script injection.  While the lack of complete JavaScript code and limited event handler examples prevent a definitive conclusion, the available evidence points towards a secure implementation."
